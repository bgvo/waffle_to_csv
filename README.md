A simple but useful tool to export Waffle issues into csv.

At the moment it just converts the one column at a time, but making it to export all columns is trivial.

### Usage

Copy-paste waffle_to_csv.js on the Console when you are on Waffle's board.

You're interested in selectColumn(column), where column is the column number.

Done.
